# Code Club
Code club allows you to create a 'robot' profile, assign it different technological skills, up to 1000 points altogether, and battle it against other user's on the same network, or other robots you've created. Each skill is weighted differently, so outcomes are unpredictable.

This projects makes up the View and Controller portion of an MVC design. The databse is simulated in a JavaScript file on the server, therefore it does not allow for any persisting data.
This was a personally developed application.

## Technologies
- React
- Express - Web framework used to create robust RESTful APIs
- axios - promise library for ajax calls
